# TheMoeWay Discord Bot

Multi-purpose Discord bot developed for the TMW Discord server. The bot is designed to be modular and easy to extend with new features.


## Features/Commands

Commands:
* `/_add_auto_receive` `<role_to_have>` `<role_to_get>` - Set up automatic role assignment. Users with `role_to_have` will automatically receive `role_to_get`.
